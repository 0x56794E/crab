.. topic:: Crab - scikits.recommender: Recommender systems in Python

	``Crab`` as known as ``scikits.recommender`` is a Python 
	framework for building recommender engines integrated with
	the world of scientific Python packages 
	(`numpy <http://www.scipy.org>`_, `scipy
	<http://www.scipy.org>`_, `matplotlib
	<http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_).

	The engine aims to provide a rich set of components from which you can 
	construct a customized recommender system from a set of algorithms and 
	be usable in various contexts: ** science and engineering **.
