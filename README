About

Crab is a ﬂexible, fast recommender engine for Python that integrates classic information ﬁltering recom- 
mendation algorithms in the world of scientiﬁc Python packages (numpy, scipy, matplotlib). The engine aims 
to provide a rich set of components from which you can construct a customized recommender system from a 
set of algorithms.

The project was started in 2010  by Marcel Caraciolo as a M.S.C related  project, and since then many people interested joined to help in the project.

It is currently maintained by a team of volunteers, members of the Muricoca Labs.
